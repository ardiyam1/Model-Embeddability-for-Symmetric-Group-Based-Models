# Model-Embeddability-for-Symmetric-Group-Based-Models
This repository contains computations for the paper "Model Embeddability for Symmetric Group-Based Model" by Muhammad Ardiyansyah, Dimitra Kosta and Kaie Kubjas.
# Compatible_Labeling_Function.nb
This file contains the code implemented in Mathematica that generates all G-compatible labeling functions for any finite abelian group. This is used for Table 1 which gives of all symmetric G-compatible labelings for abelian group of order up to eight.
# Friendly_Labeling_Zn.b
This file contains the code implemented in Mathematica that  generates all friendly labeling functions for any finite cyclic group. This is used for Table 6 which gives of all friendly labelings for abelian group of order up to eight.
# Friendly_Labeling_ZnxZm.nb
This file contains the code implemented in Mathematica that  generates all friendly labeling functions for any direct product of two finite cyclic groups. This is used for Table 6 which gives of all friendly labelings for abelian group of order up to eight.
# Polymake.rtf
This file contains the code to compute the volume of the spaces in Proposition 6.1.
# Monte_Carlo.nb
This file contains the code impleparamented in Mathematica that compute the volume of subspace of model embeddable Markov matrices in hachimoji 7-parameter as shown in Table 2.
# Volume_Hachimoji_3-parameter.nb
This file contains the code implemented in Mathematica that compute the volume of each spaces in hachimoji 3-parameter model in Proposition 6.2.
